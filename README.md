# The Defender's Guide - It's Dangerous to Defend Alone, Take This!

## What is the Defender's Guide?
The Defender's Guide is a project by Luke Paine and Jonathan Johnson to put all of the best defense resources for a particular aspect of an operating system into a single place.

Too often as defenders we need to have 900 tabs open with blog posts, documentation, or forum posts in order to understand a topic we are attempting to defend. No longer. 

Each guide has a long-form explanation of the underlying technology, and detection or visibility guidance.

The goal is to expand to common technologies for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. If you have any suggestions feel free to reach out to @jsecurity101 or @v3r5ace on Twitter.
